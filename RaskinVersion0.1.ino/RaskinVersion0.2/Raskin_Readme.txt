RASKIN - A Blinks game by Alex Pait
For 6+ Blinks
************************************

"The name's Raskin, thanks ferrraskin!"

In the game Raskin, you play a troublesome Gnome, intent on stealing all of the precious treasure from the most well-guarded building in the kingdom - the king's castle itself! Make your way from room to room, avoiding guards and gathering treasure until you've stolen everythign there is to steal. As a Gnome, you're small and nimble enough to hide from the guard in your room - you hide behind their legs, or in a cupboard, or their lunchbox - but when traversing the empty hallways between rooms, you become vulnerable to guards peering through! If you can manage to make it through, you'll be presented with your glittering prizes.


HOW TO PLAY
************************************
Once Raskin has been installed into your Blinks, double-click any Blink to make it your Blue starting room. This one is free, but from here on out you are in danger. Each Blink has a Guard represented by a Red light spinning around. Look at the rooms adjacent to you, and pick the one you want to move into. Watch each guard carefully - it's a cinch to sneak past the Guard in the room, but the ones nex it are monitoring the hallways closely. If at any time a Guard is facing your destination, that room is a threatened space and moving to it will be certain death. Watch carefully for a moment whan all guards are looking away from your destination, then make your move. Single-click the Blink you wish to occupy, and see if you made it there safely. If you got to the new space safely, that Blink will turn Blue and the previous Blink will turn Green. If you got caught, all of your Blinks will turn Red, signifying your incredibly bloody death. To start a new game, double-click a Blink and the rooms will reset. If you get to each room without being caught, you will escape with your prize!

Single-Click: Move to an adjacent room. If a rid light points to your destination you get caught and die. Otherwise you successfully move.

Double-Click: Start a new game.
